Table of Contents support is based on [jekyll-toc](https://github.com/allejo/jekyll-toc).

If you use the `post-toc` layout, a table of contents will be automatically generated based on all `##` headings - this is defined by `h_max=2` in `_layouts/post-toc.html` file, which you can change to fit your need.

The following is an example:

## Python Basics

### Math Operators

From **Highest** to **Lowest** precedence:

| Operators | Operation         | Example         |
| --------- | ----------------- | --------------- |
| \*\*      | Exponent          | `2 ** 3 = 8`    |
| %         | Modulus/Remainder | `22 % 8 = 6`    |
| //        | Integer division  | `22 // 8 = 2`   |
| /         | Division          | `22 / 8 = 2.75` |
| \*        | Multiplication    | `3 * 3 = 9`     |
| -         | Subtraction       | `5 - 2 = 3`     |
| +         | Addition          | `2 + 2 = 4`     |

## Flow Control

### Comparison Operators

| Operator | Meaning                  |
| -------- | ------------------------ |
| `==`     | Equal to                 |
| `!=`     | Not equal to             |
| `<`      | Less than                |
| `>`      | Greater Than             |
| `<=`     | Less than or Equal to    |
| `>=`     | Greater than or Equal to |

## Lists

```c
/* sets obj->mod if object is not vmlinux and module is found */
static void klp_find_object_module(struct klp_object *obj)
{
	struct module *mod;

	if (!klp_is_module(obj))
		return;

	rcu_read_lock_sched();
	/*
	 * We do not want to block removal of patched modules and therefore
	 * we do not take a reference here. The patches are removed by
	 * klp_module_going() instead.
	 */
	mod = find_module(obj->name);
	/*
	 * Do not mess work of klp_module_coming() and klp_module_going().
	 * Note that the patch might still be needed before klp_module_going()
	 * is called. Module functions can be called even in the GOING state
	 * until mod->exit() finishes. This is especially important for
	 * patches that modify semantic of the functions.
	 */
	if (mod && mod->klp_alive)
		obj->mod = mod;

	rcu_read_unlock_sched();
}
```
